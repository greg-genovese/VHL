# vue-project

In this project, I utilized Vue as the framework and Vite as the build tool. Recently, my primary focus has been on React. Upon reviewing the job posting from Vista Higher Learning, I noted that they employ Vue as their JavaScript framework. Since I had not previously worked with Vue, I decided to explore it. I started with the base seed setup provided by Vite and employed the Vue options API, which was also used in the sample files, so I opted to continue with that approach. I adhered to the same conventions I typically apply in other applications, creating components organized according to "atomic" design principles. I believe that having an organizational hierarchy is beneficial during development. Additionally, I established base style and reset CSS files to manage variables and fundamental layout styles.

I have found the process of learning Vue to be enjoyable and have come to realize that I have only begun to explore the framework's capabilities. While some of the conventions of Vue are new to me I feel like could easily adapt and contribute to a Vue project right away. I particularly appreciate how Vue encapsulates styles and offers the option to scope them to individual components, thereby preventing conflicts.

Vite has proven to be a robust build tool, significantly reducing setup time. Integrating TypeScript was remarkably straightforward, requiring only a configuration adjustment.

To run this project, please follow the steps outlined below. Thank you for taking the time to review my work, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss it further.
